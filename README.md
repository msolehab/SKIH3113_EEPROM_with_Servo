# SKIH3113_EEPROM_with_Servo
The system utilizes EEPROM to store Wi-Fi credentials (SSID and password),  and the last output status of a servo motor. Initially, the ESP8266 operates in Access Point (AP) mode, allowing users to connect and access a web interface. Through this interface, users can input and save their desired Wi-Fi settings, and servo position.
